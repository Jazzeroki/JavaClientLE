Instructions to use

To run this you'll need java installed.  You may need to also add a system variable on windows pointing to the bin folder of your java installation.  For windows see the following instructions:
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sysdm_advancd_environmnt_addchange_variable.mspx?mfr=true

otherwise open a command prompt window and go to the folder containing the file 6-9build.jar

type in
java -jar 6-9build.jar

Or if your system varialbles are setup correctly you can double click run.bat and it will launch the program in a command window.

Notes:
*************************************************
Jazz Command Console .03
Added, Functionality for, Send Spies, Repair Glyph Buildings, Upgrade Glyph Buildings, Assigning spies to training evenly

*Fixes, small fix on glyphinator so it will attempt to use more targets if some are invalid
Updated server logging so the logs are more meaningful to track down potential issues.


6-9Build Alpha .02
This is a bugs fix release
*You can now continue on into the client without it pausing after entering the account info
*Issues with the inbox reader not working properly seem to have all now been fixed
*Planet limiter has been removed so now the client can work with all the planets in a users empire rather than just the first 15 returned in the list.


6-4Build Alpha .01

The first time the client runs you'll have to select a server, and enter your username and password.  The client hangs after this.  It's a known issue, just close it, and re-open it.  You can select your account after that.  A more robust account manager is planned but not done yet.

This client is all commandline.  Required captcha's will appear in a browser window with the answer needing to be typed in the console.

Empire wide and station methods are pretty much broken at this time.  Also the client only works on up to 15 bodies including stations.  This is a limit that was added to speed up testing and will be removed when I'm ready to do so. So if only a few of your planets show up in the menu this is why.

Enjoy
